# THE PROBLEM

I took initiative in designing co-creation canvases for the creation of social robots. I discovered the problem of lack of these tools during my master's thesis. The canvases aim to solve the problems of:

- Enabling co-design
- Involving users, and experts of different domains by bringing a common language into robotics
- Structuring the design process into logical parts
- Making explicit design decisions (questioning assumptions)
- Enabling ethical considerations before building a solution

The canvases follow the process of first defining the problem space, after which design guidelines are created, which project the qualities of the problem space onto the solution space, in order to ensure purposeful design. To see a brief review of this design framework, please refer to the file "design_framework.pdf".

The canvases can be used to think about social robot design problems, to design an entirely new robot, or to modify or select an existing robot to answer a particular problem.

For the instructions on how to use the canvases, please refer to the file "robot_canvas_instructions.pdf".

# THE SOLUTION

I created a series of 8 canvases, which can be printed out and used in co-creation sessions. The canvases are grouped as follows:

# Phase 1: Problem space
- Problem space of designing a robot
- Ethical considerations of a robot

# Phase 2: Design guidelines
- Design guidelines of the robot

# Phase 3: Solution space
- Environment of the robot
- Form of the robot
- Interaction of the robot
- Behaviour of the robot

If the co-design group has only very little time, these 4 canvases can be replaced with the canvas

- MVP of the robot

referring to minimum viable product, although this canvas is recommended for playful use only.

# Sessions can be structured in two ways:

- Individuals have 10 minutes to consider their own thoughts on the canvas first, after which they can collaborate and discuss their thoughts for 10 minutes.
- Teams can collaborate simultaneously for 10-15 minutes per canvas.

Choosing the method depends on the time slot available. In order for introverts to be able to participate more easily, the first method is usually preferred. Canvases should be used in an iterative manner, and to explore each iteration of the robot as it is being created.

Canvases can also be used independently for building and analyzing social robots.

# THE OUTCOME

The canvases have been used in workshops with interested people across domains, in order to help them learn about the emerging technology of social robots, to demystify the sometimes negative media connotations of robotics, and to help in considering important ethical questions.

Some feedback form participants:

- "Useful to approach the problem from different angles, using each group member's different skills to think of new ideas and concepts"
- "The canvas helps to enhance one's own imagination, bringing forth ideas that the group would have probably not come up with otherwise."
- "The canvases helped keep to the process, helped the group stay focused."
- "I enjoyed thinking about the ethical questions, it's good to think about them. In a way it reveals some of my own biases."
